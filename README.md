The Terraform files I provided are used to create a secure VPC infrastructure with two public subnets and two private subnets. The public subnets have a NAT gateway attached to them, and the private subnets have a security group rule that allows SSH traffic only from the bastion host. The bastion host is in a public subnet and has a security group rule that allows SSH traffic from the public IP address of my computer.

The Terraform files also create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that is attached to the two private subnets. The NLB has a listener that listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to a target group. The target group has the two private instances attached to it.

The resources in the main.tf file are connected to each other as follows:

The NLB is attached to the two public subnets. This allows the NLB to receive traffic from the internet.

The private instances are attached to the NLB through a target group. This allows the NLB to distribute traffic to the private instances.

The private instances are also attached to a security group that allows traffic from the NLB. This prevents the private instances from receiving traffic from the internet directly.

The bastion instance is attached to a security group that allows SSH traffic from the public IP address of your computer. This allows you to connect to the bastion instance using SSH.

Overall, the Terraform files I provided create a secure and scalable VPC infrastructure that I can use to host Ir web applications.
